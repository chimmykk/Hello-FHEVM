# Introduction

FHEVM stands for Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine. It is a technology that makes it possible to run confidential smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains and networks.

In most blockchains, every input and output is visible to everyone. This transparency is useful for trust and record-keeping, but there are times when applications need privacy, such as voting, identity, or financial data.

FHEVM, built by Zama, provides a way to keep information encrypted during computation, so data stays private while the contract is still executed correctly.

For developers, FHEVM feels familiar: it extends Solidity with encrypted types such as euint32 and ebool. The e prefix simply marks them as encrypted versions of existing Solidity types, making it easier to learn and apply.

      question: "What does the 'e' prefix in euint32 and ebool represent?",
      options: [
        "Enhanced versions of regular types",
        "Encrypted versions of regular Solidity types",
        "Ethereum-specific types",
        "Extended functionality types"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The 'e' prefix marks encrypted versions of existing Solidity types. For example, euint32 is an encrypted version of uint32, and ebool is an encrypted version of bool. This makes FHEVM familiar to Solidity developers.",
