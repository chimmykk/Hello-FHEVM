# Introduction

FHEVM stands for Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine. It is a technology that makes it possible to run confidential smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains and networks.

In most blockchains, every input and output is visible to everyone. This transparency is useful for trust and record-keeping, but there are times when applications need privacy, such as voting, identity, or financial data.

FHEVM, built by Zama, provides a way to keep information encrypted during computation, so data stays private while the contract is still executed correctly.

For developers, FHEVM feels familiar: it extends Solidity with encrypted types such as euint32 and ebool. The e prefix simply marks them as encrypted versions of existing Solidity types, making it easier to learn and apply.
