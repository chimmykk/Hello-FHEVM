# Few things you can continue next with this project

## Basic:

 [Encryption & Decryption Guide](/getting-started#encryption--decryption)
## Good to have:

- **Party Dice**: enable multi-player based and generate randomness and trust (Like pool USD/ETH by each of them bet on different numbers winner take all)
