# Installation
*A simple guide to setup on your local dev environment*

FHEVM smart contracts are written in Solidity, just like standard Ethereum contracts, but run on an FHE-enabled EVM that supports Fully Homomorphic Encryption. This guide helps you set up everything you need to build and test confidential smart contracts locally.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of Solidity library and Ethereum
- Node.js & npm
- Hardhat (Development Framework)
- FHEVM SDK & Hardhat Plugin
- Infura API Key: Sign up at infura.io for Sepolia RPC access

## Install a Node.js LTS version

Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine.

Download and install the recommended LTS (Long-Term Support) version from the official website.

**Use an even-numbered version (e.g., v18.x, v20.x)**

Hardhat does not support odd-numbered Node.js versions. If you're using one (e.g., v21.x, v23.x), Hardhat will display a persistent warning message and may behave unexpectedly.

To verify your installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

        "Any version above v16",
        "Only odd-numbered versions (v17, v19, v21)",
        "Even-numbered LTS versions (v18, v20)",
        "Only the latest version"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Hardhat requires even-numbered LTS versions like v18.x or v20.x. Odd-numbered versions (v17, v19, v21) are not supported and will cause warnings or unexpected behavior.",

      question: "What is required to develop FHEVM smart contracts?",
      options: [
        "Just Solidity knowledge",
        "Solidity + FHEVM SDK + Hardhat Plugin",
        "Only the FHEVM SDK",
        "Just Hardhat framework"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "FHEVM development requires Solidity knowledge, the FHEVM SDK for encryption/decryption, and the Hardhat plugin for development environment. All three components work together to enable confidential smart contract development.",

      id: "infura-purpose",
      question: "Why do you need an Infura API key for FHEVM development?",
      options: [
        "To deploy contracts faster",
        "To reduce gas fees",
        "For Sepolia testnet RPC access",
        "To encrypt data locally"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Infura API key provides RPC access to Sepolia testnet, which is essential for deploying and testing FHEVM contracts. It acts as a gateway to the Ethereum network.",

      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The commands 'node -v' and 'npm -v' (or 'node --version' and 'npm --version') are used to verify that Node.js and npm are properly installed and show their version numbers.",
