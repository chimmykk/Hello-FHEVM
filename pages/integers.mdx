  questions={[
    {
      id: "euint32-basics",
      question: "What is euint32 in FHEVM?",
      options: [
        "A 32-bit encrypted unsigned integer",
        "A 32-bit regular unsigned integer",
        "A 32-bit signed encrypted integer",
        "A special type for Ethereum addresses"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "euint32 is a 32-bit encrypted unsigned integer in FHEVM. It's the encrypted version of Solidity's uint32, allowing computations on encrypted data without revealing the actual values.",
      topic: "Encrypted Types"
    },
    {
      id: "fhe-operations",
      question: "What operations can you perform on euint32 values?",
      options: [
        "Only basic arithmetic (add, subtract)",
        "Only comparison operations",
        "Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations",
        "Only storage operations"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "FHEVM supports a wide range of operations on encrypted integers including arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply), comparison (eq, lt, gt), and logical operations, all while keeping the data encrypted.",
      topic: "FHE Operations"
    },
    {
      id: "privacy-guarantee",
      question: "What happens to the actual values during FHE operations?",
      options: [
        "They are temporarily decrypted for computation",
        "They remain encrypted throughout the entire computation",
        "They are partially revealed during operations",
        "They are stored in plaintext on the blockchain"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The key feature of FHE is that values remain encrypted throughout the entire computation process. The blockchain never sees the actual values, ensuring complete privacy.",
      topic: "Privacy & Security"
    },
    {
      id: "decryption-process",
      question: "Who can decrypt euint32 values?",
      options: [
        "Anyone can decrypt any euint32 value",
        "Only the contract owner can decrypt",
        "Only the user who created the encrypted value",
        "Only miners can decrypt"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Only the user who created the encrypted value (or someone they authorize) can decrypt it. This is controlled by the FHE.allow() function in the smart contract, ensuring data privacy.",
