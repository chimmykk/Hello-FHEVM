# Testing of Smart Contracts Examples

FHEVM stands for Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine. It is a technology that makes it possible to run confidential smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains and networks.

In most blockchains, every input and output is visible to everyone. This transparency is useful for trust and record-keeping, but there are times when applications need privacy, such as voting, identity, or financial data.
